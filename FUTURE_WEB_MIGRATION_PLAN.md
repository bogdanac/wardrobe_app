# Future Web Migration Plan

## Current State ✅

**Status:** Mobile-only app with Isar database
**Data:** Your existing clothing items are safe and preserved in local Isar database
**Platform:** Android/iOS only
**Decision:** Staying mobile-only for now

---

## Future Migration to Web (When You're Ready)

When you decide to enable web deployment, here's the plan:

### Step 1: Export Existing Data
- Create export script to save all clothing items from Isar
- Export to JSON format
- Backup includes: items, outfits, categories, preferences

### Step 2: Migrate to Firebase-Only
- Remove Isar dependencies and annotations
- Update all entity models to plain Dart classes
- Delete Isar-generated `.g.dart` files
- Update repositories to use Firebase only

### Step 3: Import Data to Firebase
- Set up Firebase project (if not already done)
- Run import script to upload your items to Firestore
- Verify all data migrated correctly

### Step 4: Build and Deploy Web
- Build web version with `flutter build web`
- Deploy to hosting (Firebase Hosting, Netlify, etc.)
- Test web app with your migrated data

## Estimated Time

**When Claude does it:** ~1-2 hours total
**Your involvement:** Minimal - just approve steps and test

---

## What Happens After Migration

✅ App works on web AND mobile
✅ Data syncs across devices via Firebase
✅ Your existing items preserved
✅ Single codebase for all platforms
⚠️ Requires internet connection (no offline mode)
⚠️ Need Firebase billing for images (still free for personal use)

---

## Next Steps

**For now:** Nothing! Keep using the mobile app.

**When ready for web:** Tell Claude "I'm ready to migrate to web" and this plan will be executed.
