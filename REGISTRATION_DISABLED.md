# User Registration Disabled

New user registration has been disabled for this app. Only existing users can sign in.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Login Screen (UI Level)
- Removed the "Sign Up" toggle button
- Removed all sign-up related UI elements
- Login screen now only shows sign-in functionality

### 2. Auth Service (Code Level)
- `signUpWithEmail()` method now throws an exception if called
- Original code is commented out for future reference if you need to re-enable

### 3. Backend Protection (IMPORTANT - Manual Setup Required)

**You MUST add these Firebase Security Rules to prevent new user creation at the backend level.**

#### Steps to Add Security Rules:

1. Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Build** → **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains** (optional)
4. Go to **Build** → **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
5. Add the following rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Helper function to check if user exists (was created before lockdown)
    function isExistingUser() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }

    // Only allow existing authenticated users to read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /clothing_items/{itemId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }

    match /outfits/{outfitId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }

    match /colors/{colorId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }

    match /categories/{categoryId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }

    match /outfit_styles/{styleId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Optional: Disable Authentication Methods in Firebase Console

For additional security, you can also:

1. Go to **Build** → **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
2. Keep only the sign-in methods you need (Email/Password and Google)
3. Note: You cannot completely disable these methods, but the rules above will prevent new users from creating accounts

## Current Sign-In Options

Users can only sign in with:
1. **Existing Email/Password** - Only accounts that were created before this change
2. **Google Sign-In** - Note: If a new Google account tries to sign in, Firebase will create a new user. See below for how to prevent this.
3. **Continue Without Account** - Local storage only, no cloud sync

## Preventing New Google Sign-Ins

Google Sign-In automatically creates new users. To prevent this, you have two options:

### Option A: Disable Google Sign-In Entirely
If you don't need Google sign-in, disable it in Firebase Console:
1. Go to **Build** → **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
2. Click on **Google**
3. Toggle it off

### Option B: Add Email Whitelist
Keep Google sign-in but only allow specific email addresses. Update `auth_service.dart`:

```dart
// Add this list at the top of the AuthService class
final List<String> _allowedEmails = [
  'your-email@gmail.com',
  // Add other allowed emails here
];

// Update signInWithGoogle method
Future<UserCredential?> signInWithGoogle() async {
  try {
    final GoogleSignInAccount? googleUser = await _googleSignIn.signIn();

    if (googleUser == null) {
      return null;
    }

    // Check if email is whitelisted
    if (!_allowedEmails.contains(googleUser.email)) {
      await _googleSignIn.signOut();
      throw Exception('This email is not authorized. Please contact the administrator.');
    }

    // Rest of the existing code...
    final GoogleSignInAuthentication googleAuth = await googleUser.authentication;
    final credential = GoogleAuthProvider.credential(
      accessToken: googleAuth.accessToken,
      idToken: googleAuth.idToken,
    );
    final userCredential = await _auth.signInWithCredential(credential);
    return userCredential;
  } catch (e) {
    debugPrint('Google sign in error: $e');
    rethrow;
  }
}
```

## How to Re-enable Registration

If you need to allow new users again in the future:

1. **Restore the UI**: Uncomment the signup toggle in `login_screen.dart` (lines removed around line 257)
2. **Restore the method**: Uncomment the code in `auth_service.dart` `signUpWithEmail()` method (lines 45-54)
3. **Update Firebase Rules**: Modify the Firestore rules to allow new user creation

## Testing

After making these changes:
1. Try to sign in with an existing account - ✅ Should work
2. Try to create a new account - ❌ Should not see the option
3. Try to sign in with a new Google account - ⚠️ Will create a new user unless you implement Option A or B above

## Questions?

If you need to:
- Add a specific user manually
- Re-enable registration temporarily
- Allow specific email domains

You can do this through the Firebase Console:
1. Go to **Build** → **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Click **Add User** to manually create accounts
